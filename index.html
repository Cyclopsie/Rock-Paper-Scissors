        <h1>ROCK, PAPER, & SCISSORS</h1>
        <h2 class="rul">Rules</h2>
        <div class="rules">There are three choices for your weapons:
            The sturdy "ROCK", The flimsy "PAPER", or The sharp "SCISSORS"
            The computer will also selection their weapon of choice. Of course not one weapon is superior to the others. 
            Each have their weakness. ROCK is powerful against SCISSORS. SCISSORS sharpness is no power towards PAPER. 
            PAPER is so flimsy it could wrap all the way around ROCK.
